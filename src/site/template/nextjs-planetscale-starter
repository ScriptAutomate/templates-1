This starter app combines the powers of [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com)’s serverless databases with Prisma’s next-gen ORM and NextAuth.js for authentication to create a Next.js starter app that you can scale with. In this starter app, any users that sign up or log in are automatically stored in your PlanetScale database. There is also a built-in admin page, where you can see your users. 

_Note: You will need to follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://github.com/planetscale/nextjs-planetscale-starter) to get your PlanetScale database up and running._
